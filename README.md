# Random Event Hider
Also annoyed by those pesky random events? **This plugin adds the ability to hide specific random events.** You can hide your own and/or other players' random events on a per random event basis.

If you experience any issues or have any concerns, please reach out to YvesW via a GitHub Issue, by Discord direct messaging or via the RuneLite Discord by mentioning @Yves W.

Currently the hide Maze and hide Mime random event options might be switched. They are both triggered by the Mysterious Old Man and I have to get the specific event to determine his NpcId.

Thanks to Annex/Desaus for the suggestion!
